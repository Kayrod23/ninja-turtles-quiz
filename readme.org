* The Ninja Turtles Personality Quiz

A toy command-line app for my daughter.

It's based heavily on a personality quiz from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Secrets of the Sewer exhibit, currently at the Liberty Science Center in NJ.

But it imagines a fifth ninja turtle named Alice. Because that's what Alice imagined.
